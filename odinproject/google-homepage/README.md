# Fake Google-Homepage
This is a HTML/CSS Project from [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) Curriculum.
The Goal was to build a fake Google Page only with HTML and CSS to demonstrate the basic knowledge. Links and Buttons were never ment to work.
All what was needed is basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.

The challenging part of this project was the structure/layout.
